So I recently had the opportunity to measure the quality of junior developers. What I was shocked is the level of skill out there.

My theory is that programmers have garnered the same aspiration of doctors, scientists, pilots, etc.

The market is flooded by the glory seekers, looking to get some of the lime light.

You either love code or you love money, which results in some trying to be programmers but cannot code. Something a fizzbuzz style test can help you discover.

If you love code then you love to talk about it, I am yet to find a true code lover that cannot contain themselves. Given the chance they will spend hours trying to explain something they worked on to anyone who appears interested.

I also need to remind myself that we all had to start somewhere but there is also the realization that no matter how hard one tries, a pig cannot bark.
