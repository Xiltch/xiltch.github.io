In the [Previous Post][prev_post] I spoke about the changes to my desk setup to mount my new [monitor][monitor] to help with my posture and ergonomics. That post drew quite some attention to my surprise, with some interest into my personal equipment.

So here is a quick summary of my personal rig. It is a little bit dated, but still gets the job done.

* Monitor: [Samsung G9 Odyssey 49" Dual-QHD 32:9 Ultrawide][monitor]
* Graphics Card: [EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 SC2 GAMING iCX][graphics]
* CPU: [Intel Core i7 7700k processor][cpu]
* Motherboard: [ASUS TUF Z270 Mark 1][motherboard]
* Memory: [Team T-Force DARK 16GB (2 x 8GB) 288-Pin DDR4 SDRAM DDR4 3000][memory]
* Storage: [Samsung 970 EVO NVMe M.2 1TB SSD][nvme]
* Storage: [Samsung 840 EVO SATA III 2.5 inch 250 GB SSD][ssd]
* Storage: [Seagate Barracuda 1TB 7200 RPM SATA 6gbs][hdd]
* PSU: [Seasonic FOCUS Plus 550 Platinum SSR-550PX 550W 80+ Platinum ATX12V & EPS12V Full Modular 120mm][psu]
* Case: Huntkey Midi Tower Case
* Keyboard: [Coolermaster Masterkeys Pro S (White) Cherry MX Brown][keyboard]
* Mouse: [Roccat Kone XTD Laser Gaming Mouse][mouse]
* Desk Pad: [HyperX Fury Gaming Pad][deskpad1] and [Reflex Lab Silky Smooth 5mm 36 x 12][deskpad2]
* Headset: [HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset][headset]

I also bought a simple [USB Switch][usbswitch] that allows me to switch the input between my Personal Gaming Rig and my work laptop. This really helps save time from constantly having to disconnect and switch cables around.
