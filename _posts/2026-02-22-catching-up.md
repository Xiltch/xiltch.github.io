In the [Previous Post][prev_post], I shared the equipment used to tickle my tech urge. Not much has really changed with it, got a new case with the goal of Building a dual purpose machine around Unraid and Gaming ... sadly it was not powerfull enough for that. So a second hand Dell 7820 helped kick start my home lab setup, so maybe a future post...

It has been a moment, and a lot has happened in the last 5 years. Moved to Scotland and now enjoying a quiet life out in the country, with the occasional glass of scotch. I would like to say it has been smooth sailing but life has a funny way of sneaking up on you. Over the past 10 years, there have been many challenges that left me asking how on earth will I get through it. Hindsight is always 20/20 and it is amazing what we can actually survive and how it tempers us.

A new year once again and a lot happening in the world, I have some thoughts and fears but all in all, I remain optimistic. A new generation is starting getting molded and it will be curious to see how they navigate this mine field we call life. 

I was planning to resume with something more current ... a new 'fad' is engulfing the world, but thought it best to start slow with a short catch up. For my next post, lets take look at the rise of AI which has everyone abuzz.
