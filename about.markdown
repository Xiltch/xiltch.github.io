From as far back as I can remember, I have had this curiosity to understand how things work. 

Most of my toys growing never lasted long because I would very quickly disassemble them. Over the years I grew increasingly interested with computers starting with experiences dating back to the [Commodore 64][Commodore64]. 

I have had to navigate my way through different flavours of DOS, experienced the evolution of windows from 3.1 right through to Windows 10.

I have gone through the baptism of fire one does when trying to learn linux off some very early base distro (I vaguely recall it had the word "mother" in it). It was a very rough experience. Later I did myself no additional favors when I thought to give Gentoo linux a go ... again not a great experience. I soon started to get my feet nice and wet with firewall based systems which naturally meant I was using OpenBSD which will always have a soft spot in my heart. I seem to have settled on Ubuntu which is becoming a staple flavor for most developers.

Speaking of Software development, I have wondered the various languages starting with Visual Basic 6 (We all had to start somewhere). I now prefer either C# or Java but will also enjoy building stuff using Typescript and Angular.

I am now looking to explore the world of cluster computing, exploring a DIY build using ARM based SBC micro servers running a home based [serverless system][openfaas].

I hope you enjoy my ramblings and may they help you in some way.
